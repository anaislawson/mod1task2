Module 1 Task#2

reproducibility/installation/usage
My device loops through 4 scenes the "sunrise", "sunset", "moonrise", and Z's and counting sheep 
In the first scene, I used the fill_circle to display the "sun" by filling the circle with yellow but also indicating a transition in sunrise by changing the color of the previous circles to the background color.
I also display my name in text with a black background
These both occur randomly by using a random number generator that displaces the position as well as moving the circle in an upward direction

In the second scene, I used the fill_circle to display the "sun" by filling the circle with a darker yellow and bluer background but also indicating a transition in sunrise by changing the color of the previous circles to the background color.
I also display my name in text with a black background
These both occur randomly by using a random number generator that displaces the position as well as moving the circle in a downward direction

In the third scene, I used the fill_circle to display the "moon" by filling the circle with white and dark background but also indicating a transition in sunrise by changing the color of the previous circles to the background color.
I also display my name in text with a black background
These both occur randomly by using a random number generator that displaces the position as well as moving the circle in an upward direction

In the last scene, I also change the color to a pink color(tft.color565(218, 191, 255)
I randomly placed the texts both the Z's and sheep count by using random(200)
For the sheep count I just iterated through 99 sheep (1 to 99(<100 in my for loop)

I uploaded the code to the ESP32 by connecting my usb-c to between the device and my computer and hitting the upload button

I charge the 5V battery by first soldering it to a wire connector that would connect it to the device and then afterward I would connect it while the device was still connected to the computer
When the battery was fully charged the device's light would turn off

When hanging up our installation we used cardstock that had a display window cut out as well as whole to put string through and then connect to a popsicle stick that would then be hung
I also used double tape for the cardstock "carrier" that would hold the device and the 5V battery
